Each file contains specific information as follows：

se.txt: list of side effect names
protein-dict-map.txt: a complete ID mapping between protein names and UniProt ID
protein.txt: list of protein names
mat-protein-protein.txt : Protein-Protein interaction matrix
mat-protein-drug.txt : Protein-Drug interaction matrix
mat-protein-disease.txt : Protein-Disease association matrix
mat-drug-se.txt : Drug-SideEffect association matrix
mat-drug-protein.txt : Drug_Protein interaction matrix (transpose of the above matrix)
mat-drug-drug.txt : Drug-Drug interaction matrix
mat-drug-disease.txt : Drug-Disease association matrix
drug-dict-map.txt: a complete ID mapping between drug names and DrugBank ID
drug.txt: list of drug names
disease.txt: list of disease names
